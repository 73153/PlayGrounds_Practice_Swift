/*NOTE
Swift‚Äôs String type is bridged seamlessly to Foundation‚Äôs NSString class. If you are working with the Foundation framework in Cocoa or Cocoa Touch, the entire NSString API is available to call on any String value you create, in addition to the String features described in this chapter. You can also use a String value with any API that requires an NSString instance.
For more information about using String with Foundation and Cocoa, see Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C.

String literals can include the following special characters:
The escaped special characters \0 (null character), \\ (backslash), \t (horizontal tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quote) and \' (single quote)
Single-byte Unicode scalars, written as \xnn, where nn is two hexadecimal digits
Two-byte Unicode scalars, written as \unnnn, where nnnn is four hexadecimal digits
Four-byte Unicode scalars, written as \Unnnnnnnn, where nnnnnnnn is eight hexadecimal digits*/
